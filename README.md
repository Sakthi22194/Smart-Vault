### **The Smart Vault: Automated & Cost-Optimized EBS Snapshot Backup**  

#### **Project Overview**  
The Smart Vault is an **automated backup solution for Amazon EC2 instances**, designed to prevent data loss, reduce storage costs, and ensure compliance in **2025 and beyond**. By leveraging **AWS Lambda, EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch**, this system streamlines EBS snapshot management, providing a hands-free, **scalable disaster recovery solution** for businesses of all sizes.  

#### **Architecture & Components**  
- **EC2 Instances** – Tagged with `"Backup: True"` to identify which instances require backups.  
- **EBS Snapshots** – Incremental backups of EC2 volumes, ensuring efficient data retention.  
- **Amazon EventBridge** – Automates the scheduling of daily or periodic backups.  
- **AWS Lambda** – Handles snapshot creation, tagging, and automated deletion based on retention policies (e.g., 7 days).  
- **Amazon SNS** – Sends real-time alerts on backup success or failure.  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** –  
  - **Logs** – Stores snapshot-related activity for auditing and monitoring.  
  - **Alarms** – Triggers alerts for unusual storage growth or backup failures.  
- **(Optional) Amazon S3** – Provides additional cross-region backup redundancy if required.  

#### **Key Features & Benefits**  
 **Automated & Scheduled Backups** – Eliminates manual snapshot management.  
 **Cost Optimization** – Implements retention policies to prevent unnecessary storage costs.  
 **Compliance & Security** – Ensures data resilience and meets regulatory standards.  
 **Monitoring & Alerts** – CloudWatch and SNS provide real-time insights into backup health.  

#### **Use Cases**  
- **Enterprises & Startups** – Protect critical workloads with **hands-free AWS-native backups**.  
- **Freelancers & Small Businesses** – Use AWS Free Tier to maintain cost-effective disaster recovery.  
- **Compliance-Driven Industries** – Automate snapshot retention for audit and security purposes.  

#### **Setup & Deployment Guide**  
1. **Tag EC2 instances** with `"Backup: True"` for automatic detection.  
2. **Create an EventBridge Rule** to trigger scheduled backups.  
3. **Deploy AWS Lambda** functions to manage snapshot creation and retention.  
4. **Set up Amazon SNS** for instant notifications.  
5. **Configure CloudWatch Logs & Alarms** to monitor backup status.  
6. *(Optional)* **Enable S3 replication** for cross-region data redundancy.
